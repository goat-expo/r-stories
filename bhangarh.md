# Bhangarh 

one time I go to visit Jaipur (pink city) and decided to visit bhangarh fort that was approx. 80km away from Jaipur I have 3 camera ,3 motion sensor light , emf (electro magnetic field) , spirit box,  then I place camera at the rooms &   
 place motion sensor light in front of the cameras then i check the room using EMF  detector that was blinking 5 dots that means there is a ghost and I try to talk with ghost using spirit box then after 10min ghost said 
"I will kill you " I was two scared and Pick up my material and go to hotel then next day I again go to visit bhangarh fort and then pick up my camera and go to home and then check the recording i was shocked {to be continued } (bhangarh 2 realising soon)
